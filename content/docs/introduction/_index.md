This is a small site to help the local psychiatric trainees to acquire their psychotherapy competences.

## Psychotherapy training

Psychotherapy training for Psychiatric trainees proceeds in two phases. For Core trainees there is a certain number of cases to be contucted under supervision and a certain number of Balint groups to participate in. This is evidenced by WPBA forms gathered well in advance of your next ARCP. For Higher trainees psychotherapy requirements are less well defined, but exist.
